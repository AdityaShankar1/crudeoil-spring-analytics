# Spring Boot Data Analytics ðŸŒ±

A simple Spring boot application for an analytics engine that takes data from MySQL and performs analysis and generates report in real-time. 

## Overview

This project showcases how to leverage Spring Boot for building a backend service that performs data analytics on a dataset, integrating with a MySQL database.The original goal was to see if Java could handle data analytics tasks similarly to Python. While Python remains simpler for quick analysis, this project has grown to incorporate *MySQL* and *Docker*, moving it toward an **enterprise-style application* rather than a simple analytics script.

## Features

- Connects to a MySQL database containing oil production data.
- Uses Spring Data JPA for ORM and database interactions.
- Custom YearAttributeConverter for mapping Java Year to integer in the database.
- Provides data aggregation operations: minimum, maximum, and average quantity.
- Clean, modular code to demonstrate best practices with Spring Boot and JPA.

## Future Potential
- In theory, this setup can evolve into a *real-time report generator*. Once fully developed:  
- Data fed into MySQL would immediately update calculations and instantaneous download of up-to-date reports
- Fully modular ERP-style architecture
- Reports could be generated instantaneously with a GUI for interactive report generation 
- Continuous monitoring of datasets would be possible (ideal for frequently updating data like stock prices)

Currently, this project serves as a *comparative study between Spring Boot and Python for data analytics*, while laying groundwork for an enterprise application with modular architecture, database integration, and Docker support.
